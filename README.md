A personal website that has been built using [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

## Getting started

To get started with this template, first install the npm dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` variable to your site's public URL:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://example.com
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the website.

## Customizing

You can start editing this template by modifying the files in the `/src` folder. The site will auto-update as you edit these files.

## Publishing a new article

You can create a new article by adding a `my-article-ulr.md` file in the `/pages/articles` folder. The site will auto-update as you edit these files. If you want to add pictures to the article you create a new foled `my-article-ulr` instead with `index.mdx` and picture files in it.
